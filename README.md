# Numerical-Methods
Repository containing codes made in Mech 105 class at CSU for numerical methods. 
The numerical methods in this repository include:
  -Simpson's 1/3 rule
  -LU factorization
  -False position
In this class we discussed a number of numerical methods for finding derivatives, integrals, position, and 
factors related to data collection and analysis. We used these codes in the context of systems of equations
representing physical systems to further our understanding of problem solving.
